# TagRef

A small app to display reference images for artists. Inspired by [GestureDrawing3](https://cubebrush.co/advanches/products/d9q6yq/gesturedrawing), but with the ability to filter the displayed files, and designed to play well with [TagSpaces](https://www.tagspaces.org/).

  * **Structured:** Build your own schedule of image sets and breaks.
